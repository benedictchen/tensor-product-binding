üè∑Ô∏è Enumerations for Tensor Product Binding System
==================================================

This module defines all enumeration types used throughout the tensor product
binding system. These enums provide type-safe configuration options and
standardize the various methods and types used in TPB operations.

Based on:
- Smolensky (1990) tensor product variable binding theory
- Modern extensions for neural architectures
