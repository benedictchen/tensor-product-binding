üè∑Ô∏è Tensor Product Binding - Enumerations Module  
===============================================

Split from tensor_product_binding.py (1103 lines ‚Üí modular architecture)
Part of tensor_product_binding package 800-line compliance initiative.

Author: Benedict Chen (benedict@benedictchen.com)
Based on: Smolensky (1990) "Tensor Product Variable Binding and the Representation of Symbolic Structures"

üéØ MODULE PURPOSE:
=================
Core enumerations for tensor product binding operations.
Defines the types of mathematical operations available for binding vectors.

üî¨ RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
======================
Based on Smolensky (1990) theoretical framework with modern extensions:
- OUTER_PRODUCT: Classic tensor product (role ‚äó filler)
- CIRCULAR_CONVOLUTION: Memory-efficient circular convolution  
- ADDITION/MULTIPLICATION: Simple operations for basic binding

This module contains the enumeration definitions, split from the
1103-line monolith for clean separation of concerns.
