# Tensor Product Binding

Structured knowledge representation in neural networks via tensor products

## Overview

This library implements tensor product binding mechanisms for representing structured knowledge in neural networks. It provides compositional semantics, neural binding operations, and symbolic structure handling based on foundational research in cognitive science and neural computation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install tensor-product-binding
```

## Usage

```python
from tensor_product_binding import TensorProductBinding, CompositionalSemantics

# Initialize binding system
tpb = TensorProductBinding(dimension=512)

# Create compositional representations
semantics = CompositionalSemantics()
structure = semantics.compose("agent", "loves", "patient")

# Perform binding operations
bound_repr = tpb.bind(structure)
```

## Features

- **Neural Binding**: Tensor product operations for structured representations
- **Compositional Semantics**: Systematic composition of meaning structures
- **Symbolic Structures**: Integration of symbolic and neural approaches
- **Research-Accurate**: Based on cognitive science literature

## Research Foundation

Based on foundational work in:
- Paul Smolensky's tensor product representations
- Compositional semantics in neural networks
- Structured knowledge representation
